%%  THE ABSTRACT
%%  ============
%%
%%  From the UMass Dartmouth Thesis Guide
%%  "Requirements for Theses and Dissertations" (Spring 2015) 
%%  
%%  5.1.4 Abstract
%%  --------------
%%  The thesis or dissertation must contain an abstract — a concise summary of
%%  the thesis or dissertation intended to inform a prospective reader about
%%  its content. It usually includes a brief description of the problem
%%  investigated, the procedures or methods used, the findings, and the
%%  conclusions. It may use one or a few paragraphs; however, it is very rare
%%  that an abstract should use more than two pages, and many use just one page. 
%%
\abstract[short]{%
  Human actions may be observed from multi-view, i.e., different cameras at the same time. Cross-view action recognition based on visual content is very challenging because the actions in different views may be internally related, but they look very different in the videos. With the help of improved dense trajectories (IDT), hand-crafted features satisfactory performance has been achieved on single-view, but these often fail for cross-view action recognition, due to non-discriminative features or feature space shift across the views.  In this study, we proposed a novel method for cross-view action recognition by getting discriminative features for each view and bringing them into a common subspace via a novel joint dictionary and transfer learning framework. The dictionary learning method aims to learn a structured dictionary shared by all classes, and the learned dictionary shares the latent representation of data through a group of linear mappings and learns the sparse discriminative coefficients for each view. In the meanwhile, the encoded discriminative features are projected to a common feature space across different views through transfer learning. The dictionary and transfer learning are alternatively optimized to ensure discriminative and transferable features for cross-view action recognition. The proposed method has been extensively evaluated on PKU-MMD dataset to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

%%  THE ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
%%  ====================
%%
%%  From the UMass Dartmouth Thesis Guide
%%  "Requirements for Theses and Dissertations" (Spring 2015) 
%%  
%%  5.1.5 Acknowledgments
%%  ---------------------
%%  Short statements of acknowledgment of indebtedness (e.g., thanks to one’s
%%  thesis or dissertation advisor, to other professors, to people who have
%%  given support) may appear on a separate page right after the abstract. An
%%  acknowledgments section is required if the author has received permission to
%%  use previously copyrighted material or is obliged to acknowledge grant
%%  sources. This section is present in most theses or dissertations and is used
%%  to express a very specific professional or personal indebtedness. For
%%  example, significant instances of collaboration with one or more others in
%%  one’s thesis or dissertation work would probably need acknowledgment in a
%%  Preface (see 5.1.8) or in this Acknowledgments section—for example, research
%%  undertaken together with another student or use of much material from some
%%  other investigator.
%%
%%  The acknowledgements should be written in a professional manner. When
%%  writing the acknowledgments, be sure that your use of “person” is
%%  consistent.  If you begin with references to yourself as “the author,”
%%  continue to use third person throughout. If you begin with first person
%%  (“I,” “me,” “my”), use first person consistently.  There are two accepted
%%  spellings of the word “acknowledgments” (the other is “acknowledgements”);
%%  be sure to spell this word consistently.
%%
\acknowledgements{%
  Foremost I would like to express my sincere appreciation and gratitude to my Thesis Advisor, Dr. Ming Shao, for the patient guidance, encouragement, motivation and advice he has provided. His guidance helped me in all the time of research and writing of this thesis. 
  
  I have been with Dr. Shao for the past two years, and he would meet with me regularly on a weekly basis even on summer and winter breaks. He was extremely quick in response to emails even during vacations. He had a confidence in me, and he pushed me through my good and bad times to give my best. He is the main reason that I am proceeding with my PhD at University of Massachusetts Dartmouth. It is my honor to work under his guidance.%\\
  
  %\noindent
  I would like to thank my Thesis Committee, Dr. David Koop and Dr. Maoyuan Sun for agreeing to be part of my thesis committee and their valuable feedback. %\\
  %\noindent
  
  At last but not least, I would like to thank my family, parents, siblings, cousins, my uncle and friends, for all kind of support that they provided me, and without them I would not be going for my PhD today.

%%
%%  THE PREFACE (optional)
%%  ======================
%%
%%  From the UMass Dartmouth Thesis Guide
%%  "Requirements for Theses and Dissertations" (Spring 2015) 
%%  
%%  5.1.8 Preface (optional)
%%  ------------------------
%%  Most theses or dissertations will not have a Preface, which is called for
%%  only for unusual reasons, e.g., when the genesis of the work needs to be
%%  explained or when the author’s contribution to a multiple-authored work must
%%  be noted. If there is a preface, however, it would incorporate any
%%  acknowledgments instead of those appearing as a separate section.
%%  
%%  Preface sections are rarely used.  The first chapter (sometimes called
%%  “Introduction”) in the text section is the appropriate place for
%%  explanations of the context or the motivations that underlie the research,
%%  the research problem, the background of previous scholarship, notable
%%  contributions by other scholars, and so forth. Use a “Preface” section only
%%  for special purposes beyond such purposes as these; examples of such a
%%  special purpose are covered in sections 7.4 and 8.5.
%%  
%%
%%  7.4 Translations by the Author of Material Used
%%  ----------------------------------------------- 
%%  Material that you translate is still the intellectual property of the
%%  author. It must be documented fully (its original-language source cited
%%  properly and included in the bibliography). An appropriate note indicates by
%%  whom it has been translated, by you or someone else. If a thesis or
%%  dissertation will have extensive use of such material, this might be an
%%  occasion for an explanation in a Preface.  Usually, translators of published
%%  works will be indicated in the standard documentation of your notes and/or
%%  bibliography.
%% 
%%  8.5 Collaborative Work That Will Appear in a Thesis or Dissertation
%%  -------------------------------------------------------------------
%%  A thesis or dissertation must represent work done principally if not
%%  entirely by the author. When there are minor instances of research
%%  collaboration, an appropriate citation may be used. If extensive, however,
%%  the committee must approve it in detail and an explanation in a Preface
%%  section is called for (see sections 5.1.8).
%% 
%%  
%%  The preface should be written in a professional manner. When writing the
%%  acknowledgments, be sure that your use of “person” is consistent.  If you
%%  begin with references to yourself as “the author,” continue to use third
%%  person throughout. If you begin with first person (“I,” “me,” “my”), use
%%  first person consistently.

%%
%%  THE EPIGRAPH (optional)
%%  =======================
%%
%%  Some authors include a quotation (epigraph) or illustration (frontispiece)
%%  as the last of their preliminary pages. Neither should be listed in the
%%  table of contents, although a frontispiece may be included in the list of
%%  illustrations. The source of an epigraph is indicated below the quotation
%%  but is not listed in the bibliography or references unless it is also
%%  cited in the text. A page number need not be shown, but the page is
%%  counted in the sequential page numbering.

%%  The default option is a epigraph (text).
%%  The two LaTeX commands below will produce the same output.

%%\section{Appendictical Numbering}

%%Appendices are labeled alphabetically rather than numerically as with chapters.

%%\section{Getting the labels right \ldots}

%Sections in the first appendix will be labeled A.1, A.2 etc.  Similarly,
%subsections, equations, figures and tables will have a leading A.   This will
%be reflected in the Table of Contents, List of Figures and List of Tables in
%the prologue pages.

%This is labeled Appendix B.

%
%If there is only one appendix, it is called ``Appendix'' (not ``Appendix

%The {\tt $\backslash$singleappendix} command also ensures that the section and
